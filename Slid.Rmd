```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## The Idea

This app is built on a very simple idea, all that you have to do is to enter a date and the app will tell you in which day was/will it. So finally you can know in which day you born :D 

## Enter the date

- The date takes the format YYYY-mm-dd
- Yo can select the date from the select menu.

## The programing behind
weeksday() function in **R** returns the day of any date. So to know in which day we are just run
```{r, echo = TRUE}
weekdays(Sys.Date())
```

## Algrithim to do it manually

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Take the date
a=as.Date("1987/08/10",format="%Y/%m/%d")

# Find the difference between the system date and this date
d=as.numeric(Sys.Date()-a)
# Find the reminder with 7
r=d%%7
#Find this day in the week :D
format(Sys.Date()-d, "%a")
```
